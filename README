ivoatex Version 0.1
===================

This is another attempt at a generalised authoring system for IVOA
(http://www.ivoa.net) documents with the design goals of

 * version-controlled source file(s)
 * reasonable-quality PDF and HTML output
 * low to moderate installation effort (on POSIX systems with TeX)
 * support with routine drudgery.


Quick start
===========

ivoatex is designed to be used from within a subdirectory of the directory
containing the document sources.  You could include a checkout of ivoatex in
your document tree, but it's much more elegant to use svn:externals.  If
you don't want to use svn:externals (yet), do step (1), put ivoatex
into your document directory, and skip to (10) below


To prepare for writing a Note called MyNote for the working group mywg
with revision control on volute with svn:externals, do something like

(0) export VOLUTEBASE=https://volute.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/projects
(1) export DOCNAME=?????
(this would be your document's short name, like RegTAP, SIAv2, etc)
(2) export WG=?????
(this would be your Working Group: dal, dm, edu, grid, registry, theory,...)

(3) mkdir $DOCNAME
(4) svn import MyNote $VOLUTEBASE/$WG/$DOCNAME
(5) rmdir $DOCNAME
(6) svn co $VOLUTEBASE/$WG/$DOCNAME $DOCNAME
(7) cd $DOCNAME
(8) svn propset svn:externals "ivoatex $VOLUTEBASE/ivoapub/ivoatex" .
(9) svn update
(9a) svn propset svn:ignore . --file ivoatex/svn-ignore.txt

This has the advantage that you get updates automatically and that it is 
trivial to feed back your bibliography additions and fixes into the
distribution.

If you get ivoatex in some other way, make sure the subdirectory it resides
in is called ivoatex.

(10) cp ivoatex/document.template $DOCNAME.tex
(11) cp ivoatex/Makefile.template Makefile

Fill out the marked-up things in Makefile, edit $DOCNAME.tex, and then run

* ``make`` to generate a PDF rendering of your document
* ``make biblio`` to update the bibliography (i.e., run BibTeX)
* ``make forecetex`` to unconditionally run TeX (e.g., when TeX
  asks to be rerun)
* ``make $DOCNAME.html`` to generate an HTML rendering of your document
* ``make package`` to generate a zip file containing everything needed
  for publication at ivoa.net.   Obviously, you'll want to check
  DOCVERSION, DOCTYPE, and DOCDATE in the Makefile before submitting things.


Authoring
=========

The least you need for an ivoatex instance document is::

	\documentclass{ivoatex/ivoa}
	\input ivoatex/tthdefs

and an abstract.  However, you're advised to start from the template -- it
really contains very little that you shouldn't have in your document,
except you'll need to replace all the items between the ????-groups.

Non-obvious features include:

* author takes an optional argument that would be the author's URL, 
  typically pointing into the IVOA wiki.
* previousversion will usually have its optional argument, the
  URL under which a previous version is accessible.  These URLs
  are be generateable from the version strings if publishing has
  been conforming, and we may provide a macro to deal with this later
  (but also maybe a fully automatic management of previous versions
  base on the change log?)
* ivoadoc uses natbib and BibTeX.  Don't be afraid, it's actually
  dead simple.   If you want to reference something, check out
  ivoatex/ivoabib.bib.  If what you're looking for is already in there,
  say \citep{tag} (Einstein 1905) or \citet{tag} for Einstein (1905) in
  your source, and update your bibliography using make biblio.  If
  your source isn't yet in ivoabib, please add it and contribute your
  new records.  Incidentally, no variant forms of citep and citet are 
  supported yet (but we'll try to change that).
* There's an environment for "admonition boxes" like "Note", "Tip", etc.
	Say \begin{admonition}{<admontype>}.  <admontype> will be the head
	of the box, and in the future we may also have icons for the most common
	headings.

Acknowledgements
================

The immediate predecessor of this is the document generation system created
by Mark Taylor for SAMP and VOTable; essentially, this is a generalisation
of Mark's work.  This, in turn, built on work done by Sebastien Derriere.

Another inspiration was Paul Harrison's ivoadoc system; in particular,
parts of the XSL style sheet were taken from there, as well as the idea of
using svn:externals.
