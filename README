ivoatex Version 0.1
===================

This is another attempt at a generalised authoring system for IVOA
(http://www.ivoa.net) documents with the design goals of

 * version-controlled source file(s)
 * reasonable-quality PDF and HTML output
 * low to moderate installation effort (on POSIX systems with LaTeX)
 * support with routine drudgery.


Quick start
===========

ivoatex is designed to be used from within a subdirectory of the directory
containing the document sources.  You could include a checkout of ivoatex in
your document tree, but it's much more elegant to use svn:externals.  If
you don't want to use svn:externals (yet), do step (1), put ivoatex
into your document directory, and skip to (10) below


To prepare for writing a Note called MyNote for the working group mywg
with revision control on volute with svn:externals, do something like

(0) export VOLUTEBASE=https://volute.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/projects
(1) export DOCNAME=?????
	  (this would be your document's short name, like RegTAP, SIAv2, etc)
(2) export WG=?????
    (this would be your Working Group: dal, dm, edu, grid, registry...)
(3) mkdir $DOCNAME
(4) svn import MyNote $VOLUTEBASE/$WG/$DOCNAME
(5) rmdir $DOCNAME
(6) svn co $VOLUTEBASE/$WG/$DOCNAME $DOCNAME
(7) cd $DOCNAME
(8) svn propset svn:externals "ivoatex $VOLUTEBASE/ivoapub/ivoatex" .
(9) svn update
(9a) svn propset svn:ignore . --file ivoatex/svn-ignore.txt

This has the advantage that you get updates automatically and that it is 
trivial to feed back your bibliography additions and fixes into the
distribution.

If you get ivoatex in some other way, make sure the subdirectory it resides
in is called ivoatex.

(10) cp ivoatex/document.template $DOCNAME.tex
(11) cp ivoatex/Makefile.template Makefile
(12) cp ivoatex/archdiag.png .

Fill out the marked-up things in Makefile, edit $DOCNAME.tex, and then run

* ``make`` to generate a PDF rendering of your document
* ``make biblio`` to update the bibliography (i.e., run BibTeX)
* ``make forecetex`` to unconditionally run TeX (e.g., when TeX
  asks to be rerun)
* ``make $DOCNAME.html`` to generate an HTML rendering of your document
* ``make package`` to generate a zip file containing everything needed
  for publication at ivoa.net.   Obviously, you'll want to check
  DOCVERSION, DOCTYPE, and DOCDATE in the Makefile before submitting things.

As to the architecture diagram, we deliver a placeholder.  Contact the TCG 
chair to get one tailored to your standard unless you're writing a Note.
In the latter case, remove the reference from the document template
and archdiag.png from FIGURES in the Makefile.

Authoring
=========

The least you need for an ivoatex instance document is::

	\documentclass{ivoa}
	\input tthdefs

and an abstract.  However, you're advised to start from the template -- it
really contains very little that you shouldn't have in your document,
except you'll need to replace all the items between the ????-groups.

Non-obvious features include:

* author takes an optional argument that would be the author's URL, 
  typically pointing into the IVOA wiki.
* previousversion will usually have its optional argument, the
  URL under which a previous version is accessible.  These URLs
  are be generateable from the version strings if publishing has
  been conforming, and we may provide a macro to deal with this later
  (but also maybe a fully automatic management of previous versions
  base on the change log?)
* ivoadoc uses natbib and BibTeX.  Don't be afraid, it's actually
  dead simple.   If you want to reference something, check out
  ivoatex/ivoabib.bib.  If what you're looking for is already in there,
  say \citep{tag} (Einstein 1905) or \citet{tag} for Einstein (1905) in
  your source, and update your bibliography using make biblio.  If
  your source isn't yet in ivoabib, please add it and contribute your
  new records.  Incidentally, no variant forms of citep and citet are 
  supported yet (but we'll try to change that).
* There's an environment for "admonition boxes" like "Note", "Tip", etc.
	Say \begin{admonition}{<admontype>}.  <admontype> will be the head
	of the box, and in the future we may also have icons for the most common
	headings.
* \xmlel{p} typesets its argument in some common (yet-to-be agreed-upon)
  style denoting XML element, attributes, or XPath expressions
* A hint on including XML: \usepackage{listings}\lstloadlanguages{XML}
	\lstinputlisting[language=XML,flexiblecolumns=true]{<filename>}
* Standard table formatting: We generally recommend putting
  \sptablerule before and after the headline and at the end of the table.
  This adds extra spacing which is probably not compatible with vertical
  rules; so, think twice before insisting on those.
* The bigdescription environment with a \term[MyTerm] gives a fairly
  truthful definition list markup in both PDF and HTML.

Auxiliary Files, Figures
========================

For pixel files understood by both the browser and LaTeX, using graphicx's
\includegraphics should simply work.  Don't forget to include the files you
have in the Makefile's SOURCES variable so they get included in the packages
that get submitted to the ivoa.

Vector graphics is only supported in the form of PDF graphics; use ps2pdf
or similar to convert your images as necessary.  

You *must* give your PDF figures the extension "pdffig" (it's not just "pdf" to
avoid accidents with make clean and similar).  In LaTeX, just use
includegraphics as usual.  Then add the name of the file to VECTORFIGURES in
the Makefile; ivoatex will then automatically generate the necessary bitmap
images for the HTML version.

Support for auxiliary files is in the works.

================

The immediate predecessor of this is the document generation system created
by Mark Taylor for SAMP and VOTable; essentially, this is a generalisation
of Mark's work.  This, in turn, built on work done by Sebastien Derriere.

Another inspiration was Paul Harrison's ivoadoc system; in particular,
parts of the XSL style sheet were taken from there, as well as the idea of
using svn:externals.
